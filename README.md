## About
Do you have a lot of photos on your Wordpress blog? Why not combine the power of Flickr's speed and storage with the responsive abilities of Picturefill.js?

This plugin uses the Flickr API to turn a simple shortcode into a responsive image with full browser support.

## Usage
1. Install the plugin
2. Upload your images to Flickr
3. Get the ID of the image you want to post (e.g. http://www.flickr.com/photos/username/9632889598/ - the ID for this photo is 9632889598)
4. Add the shortcode to your page/post - [picturefill id='9632889598' alt='Alternate Text']
5. Profit

Note that the Flickr API terms of use insists that all images uploaded to Flickr be photographs - and not images for websites ( logos, visual pieces, etc).
